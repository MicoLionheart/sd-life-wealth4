        <p>Many tenants overlook the importance of renters insurance, assuming their landlord’s policy covers them. However, without renters insurance, you could face financial losses in case of theft, fire, or liability claims.</p>
        
        <h2>What Renters Insurance Covers</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal Property Coverage</strong> – Protects against damage or loss of belongings due to theft, fire, or natural disasters.</li>

            <li><strong>Loss of Use Coverage</strong> – Helps with temporary housing costs if your rental becomes uninhabitable.</li>
